# **Loan Data Project README**


Welcome to my loan data project [STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND ONLY A PROTOTYPE!!].


The aim of this project is threefold:

    - Build an ETL pipeline based on event-architecture that cleans loan data from Kaggle and stores it in S3


Some constraints:

    - This project is designed in AWS

    - This project is designed to handle one file (namely the Kaggle loan file) at a time


Some notes:

    - I've included the Terraform code to build the initial infrastructure you need. Remember to destroy the resources (and any files in S3 buckets!) at the end of your session.


Hope you enjoy!
