##Loan Data Project README


Welcome to my loan data project [STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND ONLY A PROTOTYPE!!].


The aim of this project is threefold:

    - Build an ETL pipeline based on event-architecture that cleans loan data from Kaggle and stores it in Redshift

    - Normalise the data in Redshift

    - Generate insights and visualisations from the data

    - Improve my understanding of AWS and event-driven architecture


Some constraints:

    - This project is designed in AWS

    - This project is designed to handle one file (namely the Kaggle loan file) at a time


Some notes:

    - I've included the Terraform code to build the initial infrastructure you need. Remember to destroy the resources (and any files in S3 buckets!) at the end of your session.


Hope you enjoy!
